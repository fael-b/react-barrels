# react-barrels ü•É

Easily convert or create your React/Typescript component files to a barrel file structure.

## Barrel Structure

#### FROM:

- `components/MyComponent.tsx` => Messy component with type definitions, etc...

#### TO:

- `components/MyComponent/MyComponent.tsx` => Functional or class component
- `components/MyComponent/MyComponent.types.ts` => Type definitions (props, etc...)
- `components/MyComponent/index.ts` => Re-exports the contents of the `MyComponent` folder

## Features

- Right click on a _parent folder_ to create a new React component.
- Convert an existing component by using the corresponding command (`CTRL + SHIFT + P` -> "Convert to a barrel folder structure").
